.TH "scrcpy" "1"
.SH NAME
scrcpy \- Display and control your Android device


.SH SYNOPSIS
.B scrcpy
.RI [ options ]


.SH DESCRIPTION
.B scrcpy
provides display and control of Android devices connected on USB (or over TCP/IP). It does not require any root access.


.SH OPTIONS

.TP
.B \-\-always\-on\-top
Make scrcpy window always on top (above other windows).

.TP
.BI "\-\-audio\-bit\-rate " value
Encode the audio at the given bit\-rate, expressed in bits/s. Unit suffixes are supported: '\fBK\fR' (x1000) and '\fBM\fR' (x1000000).

Default is 128K (128000).

.TP
.BI "\-\-audio\-buffer ms
Configure the audio buffering delay (in milliseconds).

Lower values decrease the latency, but increase the likelyhood of buffer underrun (causing audio glitches).

Default is 50.

.TP
.BI "\-\-audio\-codec " name
Select an audio codec (opus, aac or raw).

Default is opus.

.TP
.BI "\-\-audio\-codec\-options " key\fR[:\fItype\fR]=\fIvalue\fR[,...]
Set a list of comma-separated key:type=value options for the device audio encoder.

The possible values for 'type' are 'int' (default), 'long', 'float' and 'string'.

The list of possible codec options is available in the Android documentation
.UR https://d.android.com/reference/android/media/MediaFormat
.UE .

.TP
.BI "\-\-audio\-encoder " name
Use a specific MediaCodec audio encoder (depending on the codec provided by \fB\-\-audio\-codec\fR).

The available encoders can be listed by \-\-list\-encoders.

.TP
.BI "\-b, \-\-video\-bit\-rate " value
Encode the video at the given bit\-rate, expressed in bits/s. Unit suffixes are supported: '\fBK\fR' (x1000) and '\fBM\fR' (x1000000).

Default is 8M (8000000).

.TP
.BI "\-\-crop " width\fR:\fIheight\fR:\fIx\fR:\fIy
Crop the device screen on the server.

The values are expressed in the device natural orientation (typically, portrait for a phone, landscape for a tablet). Any
.B \-\-max\-size
value is computed on the cropped size.

.TP
.B \-d, \-\-select\-usb
Use USB device (if there is exactly one, like adb -d).

Also see \fB\-e\fR (\fB\-\-select\-tcpip\fR).

.TP
.BI "\-\-disable-screensaver"
Disable screensaver while scrcpy is running.

.TP
.BI "\-\-display " id
Specify the device display id to mirror.

The available display ids can be listed by \-\-list\-displays.

Default is 0.

.TP
.BI "\-\-display\-buffer ms
Add a buffering delay (in milliseconds) before displaying. This increases latency to compensate for jitter.

Default is 0 (no buffering).

.TP
.B \-e, \-\-select\-tcpip
Use TCP/IP device (if there is exactly one, like adb -e).

Also see \fB\-d\fR (\fB\-\-select\-usb\fR).

.TP
.B \-\-force\-adb\-forward
Do not attempt to use "adb reverse" to connect to the device.

.TP
.B \-\-forward\-all\-clicks
By default, right-click triggers BACK (or POWER on) and middle-click triggers HOME. This option disables these shortcuts and forward the clicks to the device instead.

.TP
.B \-f, \-\-fullscreen
Start in fullscreen.

.TP
.B \-h, \-\-help
Print this help.

.TP
.B \-K, \-\-hid\-keyboard
Simulate a physical keyboard by using HID over AOAv2.

This provides a better experience for IME users, and allows to generate non-ASCII characters, contrary to the default injection method.

It may only work over USB.

The keyboard layout must be configured (once and for all) on the device, via Settings -> System -> Languages and input -> Physical keyboard. This settings page can be started directly:

    adb shell am start -a android.settings.HARD_KEYBOARD_SETTINGS

However, the option is only available when the HID keyboard is enabled (or a physical keyboard is connected).

Also see \fB\-\-hid\-mouse\fR.

.TP
.B \-\-legacy\-paste
Inject computer clipboard text as a sequence of key events on Ctrl+v (like MOD+Shift+v).

This is a workaround for some devices not behaving as expected when setting the device clipboard programmatically.

.TP
.B \-\-list\-encoders
List video and audio encoders available on the device.

.TP
.B \-\-list\-displays
List displays available on the device.

.TP
\fB\-\-lock\-video\-orientation\fR[=\fIvalue\fR]
Lock video orientation to \fIvalue\fR. Possible values are "unlocked", "initial" (locked to the initial orientation), 0, 1, 2 and 3. Natural device orientation is 0, and each increment adds a 90 degrees rotation counterclockwise.

Default is "unlocked".

Passing the option without argument is equivalent to passing "initial".

.TP
.BI "\-\-max\-fps " value
Limit the framerate of screen capture (officially supported since Android 10, but may work on earlier versions).

.TP
.BI "\-m, \-\-max\-size " value
Limit both the width and height of the video to \fIvalue\fR. The other dimension is computed so that the device aspect\-ratio is preserved.

Default is 0 (unlimited).

.TP
.B \-M, \-\-hid\-mouse
Simulate a physical mouse by using HID over AOAv2.

In this mode, the computer mouse is captured to control the device directly (relative mouse mode).

LAlt, LSuper or RSuper toggle the capture mode, to give control of the mouse back to the computer.

It may only work over USB.

Also see \fB\-\-hid\-keyboard\fR.

.TP
.B \-\-no\-cleanup
By default, scrcpy removes the server binary from the device and restores the device state (show touches, stay awake and power mode) on exit.

This option disables this cleanup.

.TP
.B \-\-no\-clipboard\-autosync
By default, scrcpy automatically synchronizes the computer clipboard to the device clipboard before injecting Ctrl+v, and the device clipboard to the computer clipboard whenever it changes.

This option disables this automatic synchronization.

.TP
.B \-\-no\-downsize\-on\-error
By default, on MediaCodec error, scrcpy automatically tries again with a lower definition.

This option disables this behavior.

.TP
.B \-n, \-\-no\-control
Disable device control (mirror the device in read\-only).

.TP
.B \-N, \-\-no\-display
Do not display device (only when screen recording is enabled).

.TP
.B \-\-no\-key\-repeat
Do not forward repeated key events when a key is held down.

.TP
.B \-\-no\-mipmaps
If the renderer is OpenGL 3.0+ or OpenGL ES 2.0+, then mipmaps are automatically generated to improve downscaling quality. This option disables the generation of mipmaps.

.TP
.B \-\-no\-power\-on
Do not power on the device on start.

.TP
.B \-\-otg
Run in OTG mode: simulate physical keyboard and mouse, as if the computer keyboard and mouse were plugged directly to the device via an OTG cable.

In this mode, adb (USB debugging) is not necessary, and mirroring is disabled.

LAlt, LSuper or RSuper toggle the mouse capture mode, to give control of the mouse back to the computer.

If any of \fB\-\-hid\-keyboard\fR or \fB\-\-hid\-mouse\fR is set, only enable keyboard or mouse respectively, otherwise enable both.

It may only work over USB.

See \fB\-\-hid\-keyboard\fR and \fB\-\-hid\-mouse\fR.

.TP
.BI "\-p, \-\-port " port\fR[:\fIport\fR]
Set the TCP port (range) used by the client to listen.

Default is 27183:27199.

.TP
.B \-\-power\-off\-on\-close
Turn the device screen off when closing scrcpy.

.TP
.B \-\-prefer\-text
Inject alpha characters and space as text events instead of key events.

This avoids issues when combining multiple keys to enter special characters,
but breaks the expected behavior of alpha keys in games (typically WASD).

.TP
.B "\-\-print\-fps
Start FPS counter, to print framerate logs to the console. It can be started or stopped at any time with MOD+i.

.TP
.BI "\-\-push\-target " path
Set the target directory for pushing files to the device by drag & drop. It is passed as\-is to "adb push".

Default is "/sdcard/Download/".

.TP
.B \-\-raw\-key\-events
Inject key events for all input keys, and ignore text events.

.TP
.BI "\-r, \-\-record " file
Record screen to
.IR file .

The format is determined by the
.B \-\-record\-format
option if set, or by the file extension (.mp4 or .mkv).

.TP
.BI "\-\-record\-format " format
Force recording format (either mp4 or mkv).

.TP
.BI "\-\-render\-driver " name
Request SDL to use the given render driver (this is just a hint).

Supported names are currently "direct3d", "opengl", "opengles2", "opengles", "metal" and "software".

.UR https://wiki.libsdl.org/SDL_HINT_RENDER_DRIVER
.UE

.TP
.B \-\-require\-audio
By default, scrcpy mirrors only the video if audio capture fails on the device. This option makes scrcpy fail if audio is enabled but does not work.

.TP
.BI "\-\-rotation " value
Set the initial display rotation. Possibles values are 0, 1, 2 and 3. Each increment adds a 90 degrees rotation counterclockwise.

.TP
.BI "\-s, \-\-serial " number
The device serial number. Mandatory only if several devices are connected to adb.

.TP
.BI "\-\-shortcut\-mod " key\fR[+...]][,...]
Specify the modifiers to use for scrcpy shortcuts. Possible keys are "lctrl", "rctrl", "lalt", "ralt", "lsuper" and "rsuper".

A shortcut can consist in several keys, separated by '+'. Several shortcuts can be specified, separated by ','.

For example, to use either LCtrl+LAlt or LSuper for scrcpy shortcuts, pass "lctrl+lalt,lsuper".

Default is "lalt,lsuper" (left-Alt or left-Super).

.TP
.BI "\-\-tcpip\fR[=\fIip\fR[:\fIport\fR]]
Configure and reconnect the device over TCP/IP.

If a destination address is provided, then scrcpy connects to this address before starting. The device must listen on the given TCP port (default is 5555).

If no destination address is provided, then scrcpy attempts to find the IP address and adb port of the current device (typically connected over USB), enables TCP/IP mode if necessary, then connects to this address before starting.

.TP
.B \-S, \-\-turn\-screen\-off
Turn the device screen off immediately.

.TP
.B \-t, \-\-show\-touches
Enable "show touches" on start, restore the initial value on exit.

It only shows physical touches (not clicks from scrcpy).

.TP
.BI "\-\-tunnel\-host " ip
Set the IP address of the adb tunnel to reach the scrcpy server. This option automatically enables --force-adb-forward.

Default is localhost.

.TP
.BI "\-\-tunnel\-port " port
Set the TCP port of the adb tunnel to reach the scrcpy server. This option automatically enables --force-adb-forward.

Default is 0 (not forced): the local port used for establishing the tunnel will be used.

.TP
.BI "\-\-v4l2-sink " /dev/videoN
Output to v4l2loopback device.

It requires to lock the video orientation (see \fB\-\-lock\-video\-orientation\fR).

.TP
.BI "\-\-v4l2-buffer " ms
Add a buffering delay (in milliseconds) before pushing frames. This increases latency to compensate for jitter.

This option is similar to \fB\-\-display\-buffer\fR, but specific to V4L2 sink.

Default is 0 (no buffering).

.TP
.BI "\-V, \-\-verbosity " value
Set the log level ("verbose", "debug", "info", "warn" or "error").

Default is "info" for release builds, "debug" for debug builds.

.TP
.B \-v, \-\-version
Print the version of scrcpy.
